          What differentiates Bizom?
        answer: |
          Bizom is India's only complete ecosystem player for the consumer goods industry, transforming the entire FMCG supply network from brands to wholesalers/distributors to retailers. The brand warehouse → The distributor → The salesman who takes orders at the store → Order fulfillment → Retailer digitization for self ordering. This, coupled with Bizom's proprietary analytics engine ELL that makes real-time insights really possible, helps companies drive efficiencies across the entire supply chain resulting in outcomes such as greater availability, improved manpower productivity, reduced stock in trade, just in time ordering and hence higher rotation of products.
