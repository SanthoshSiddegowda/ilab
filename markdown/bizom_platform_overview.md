# Bizom Platform Overview

## What is Bizom?

Bizom, Mobisy's flagship product, is the retail intelligence platform for brands and their retailers.

We are leaders in providing insights and intelligence to CPG brands in India and emerging markets and are now making inroads into markets in Europe and other developed markets. We help brands achieve smart distribution by improving their manpower efficiency, channel performance, and product performance.

We achieve this by helping businesses first digitise their entire sales and supply chain and later help them move from a push-based distribution to a pull-based distribution using solutions that facilitate assisted and inspired selling.

## What differentiates Bizom?

Bizom is India’s only complete ecosystem player for the consumer goods industry, transforming the entire FMCG supply network from brands to wholesalers/distributors to retailers.

Bizom provides a single source of truth for:

- The brand warehouse
- The distributor
- The salesman who takes orders at the store
- Order fulfillment
- Retailer digitization for self-ordering

This, coupled with Bizom’s proprietary analytics engine ELL that makes real-time insights really possible, helps companies drive efficiencies across the entire supply chain resulting in outcomes such as:

- Greater availability
- Improved manpower productivity
- Reduced stock in trade
- Just in time ordering
- Higher rotation of products

## Who are Bizom’s competitors?

Bizom, being a complete ecosystem player, doesn’t have any specific competitors who play across the whole stack. Our competition varies based on the type of problem we are trying to solve.

For example:

- For companies looking for distributor automation, we compete with legacy folks such as Botree, Sify FORUM, or in places even Accenture CAS.
- In the sales force productivity space, we compete with Accenture Newspage, IVY mobility, and Salesforce.
- For a brand looking for retailer digitization for self-ordering, we have almost no real established competition.
